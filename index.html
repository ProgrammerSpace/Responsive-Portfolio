        <p> Hey this is Meena !! what's about me?? </p>
        <p>I'm a <span>"dog lover"</span> - I can really love dogs more than I do love humans!!.</p>
        <p><span>"Music lover"</span> - as people say, yeah music heals. It has the perfect therapeutic
            power for any
            sort of emotion.</p>
        <p><span>"good cook"</span> and a <span>"big!! big!! foodie"</span> - Have you ever felt like to
            taste a pakka
            traditional south Indian dish?? Just let me know I won't disappoint you.</p>
        <p>And yeah I do like painting stuffs. <span>"Love for colors"</span>, I can do really good acrylic
            arts. Mixing
            colors are really interesting and you can bring down your ideas into a piece of canvas. Check the portfolio
            page for some of my works!! There are a lot more pencil-sketches and acrylic works at <a
